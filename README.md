# IpAddrGenerator

Basic tool used made and used during hardware upgrade process at current job.  Allowed coworkers to quickly find the addresses of other harware in the room based on the IP of a primary PC by counting up/down from there as all rooms using this hardware followed the same numbering conventions.
